      <h2>About Africa</h2>
      <p style="color: white;">
        Africa is the second-largest and second-most-populous continent on Earth. It is rich in cultural heritage, diverse
        ecosystems, vast natural resources, and a history that dates back to the earliest human civilizations. From the
        Sahara Desert in the north to the lush rainforests of the Congo Basin and the savannas of the Serengeti,
        Africa's landscapes are as varied as its people.
      </p>
      <p style="color: white;">
        The continent is home to 54 recognized countries, each with its own unique traditions, languages, and histories.
        Africa is a land of both ancient kingdoms and rapidly developing economies, making it a dynamic and exciting
        region of the world.
